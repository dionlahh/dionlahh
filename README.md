Hello! I'm Dion Toh Siyong. 
Currently a sophomore student at Nanyang Technological University, majoring in Computer Science.

I'm currently interested in Cyber Security, Algorithms, Software Engineering, as well as Cloud Services.

As of right now, I am trying to learn PowerShell, and how to use it effectively through resources available online. 
In school, I am learning on Object Oriented Programming in Java.
